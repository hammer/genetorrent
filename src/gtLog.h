//   created as ~/logs/(argv[0]).(timestamp).log
//

//       --log destination
//   on the command line.  In which case the following destinations
//   are allowed:
//      none       No log file will be created
//      stdout     Log will be sent to stdout
//      stderr     Log will be sent to stderr
//      syslog     Log will be sent to syslog
//      filename   Log will be written to the specified file

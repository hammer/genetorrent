   numerous performance enhancements for downloading

NOTES:  version 0.6.0.0

   This version of GeneTorrent may not be compatible with GeneTorrent 0.5.1.0

   Due to architectural changes in the way GeneTorrent interacts with and runs at the CGHub, this release of GeneTorrent is being make with less than robust testing.  After GeneTorrent Server instances, the Load Balancer, expiring torrents, etc are in place, Cardinal Peak will work to rectify any issues that arise in a timely fashion.

   Returned to using 16K block sizes for transfers.

   Updated copyright headers across GeneTorrent source code

   Eliminated the 1 GTO per Port restriction present in previous version of GeneTorrent in Server mode.

   Implemented support for expiring GTO from Servers.

   Added GTO validation before attempting to upload/download/serve a GTO file.

   Eliminated the use of /dev/shm and symlinks when using GeneTorrent to upload.

   GeneTorrent now supports dynamic block sizes in the underlying protocol.  Full Testing Pending:  This should allow creation of GTOs containing at least 1TB of data.

   Upload mode uses the command line argument -u

   Upload mode command line argument -t is deprecated (but still available)

   Upload mode only sends files listed in the manifest.xml

   Download mode now uses POST

   support for ?token= in download mode has been removed

   This release standardizes the build time debugging and optimizations to both libtorrent-cp and GeneTorrent to be -O2 -g
   



=========================== Old Release Notes =========================== 

NOTES:  version 0.5.1.0

   Fixed -f feature.

   Adds the man page.

   Cleans up warning message about disk usage at completion of each GTO download.

NOTES:  version 0.5.0.0

   THIS RELEASE IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH GeneTorrent 0.4.7.0  Running GeneTorrent 0.5.0.0 against 0.4.7.0 will result in 0.4.7.0 failing an assert and existing.

   Scanning XML files for download URIs is supported in this release.

   -c option only required when it is truly needed.

   -p option is implemented for download mode (note -p has different meanings depending on operational mode).

   Extensive error handling, command line parameter validation, and uniform error messages are included in this release.

   All libtorrent logging is sent to syslog.  libtorrent_log* and upnp.log no longer pollute the directory where GeneTorrent is executing.

   Disk space checking at start up and during downloads.  GeneTorrent will exit when about 1G of disk space remains.

   Known Issues
      
     -f <port>, --advertisedPort <port> feature may have a bug

NOTES:  version 0.4.7.0

   Downloading a .gto file no longer requires the -c option.

   Reworked the GeneTorrent Version number in the creator field in .gtos

(deprecated)   This release standardizes the build time debugging and optimizations to both libtorrent-cp and GeneTorrent to be -O0 -g3

NOTES:  version 0.4.6.0

   Added the GeneTorrent version number to the creator field in the .gto

NOTES:  version 0.4.5.0

   This release enables -v -vv -vvv and -vvvv options.  GeneTorrent will not display output unless run with -v (or higher).

   This release introduces GNU Auto Tools to the build process.

   This release adds a new digit to the release number to be compatible with the underlying protocol's application fingerprint feature.

   This release continues to carry along full debug logging.

   No changes to libtorrent-cp have been made, only a change to the build options caused the version bump.

(deprecated)   This release standardizes the build time debugging and optimizations to both libtorrent-cp and GeneTorrent to be -O2 -g

NOTES:  version 0.4.2

   This release enables "seed_mode" for server and upload client.  This allows the server process to start up quickly and avoids a double check on upload clients.

   This release also introduces a new build process that should eliminate inconsistencies encountered using rpmbuild to do compilation.

   This release reduces the underlying protocol transfer block size to 16K vs 128K previously used.

   This release runs in full debug mode.  You will encounter extra files and directories with logging/debugging information.

NOTES:  version 0.4.1

   This release implements a path fix for server mode and has slightly improved UUID error handling.

   This release runs in full debug mode.  You will encounter extra files and directories with logging/debugging information.

   This release of GeneTorrent is off the tip of the development tree.  Some features are in progress (UUID) and/or do not work (xml parsing for download).

NOTES:  version 0.4.0

   Implements a primitive edition of WSI UUID downloading.  This is rather light on error processing.

NOTES:  version 0.3.1

   The main purpose of this release is to patch a compatibility bug in libtorrent so communications with Annai's bit torrent Tracker is successful.

   A functional server mode is now available.  .gto files do NOT expire from GeneTorrent or the queue directory.  Testing on server mode has been light

NOTES:  version 0.3.0 (resolved items pushed down to the bottom of this section.)

   This release of GeneTorrent is off the tip of the development tree.  Some features are in development and do not work.

   .gto files (previously .torrent files) are only created in /dev/shm.  Previously they were also created in the working directory and /dev/shm.

   In Download mode a credentials file flag (-c) must be specified on the command line along with a file name that exists in the current directory.  At this time, the actual file is NOT used by GeneTorrent but must exist and be readable.

   Error reporting for command line argument failures is not uniform.  The help page is accurate and correctly identifies required arguments as well the format for argument parameters.

   Some command line options exist in the help screen, they are not implemented yet -v and -n for certain.

   When using upload mode, this version of GeneTorrent will use the correlation attribute in place of the UUID to be used in the future.

   This version of GeneTorrent will create one .gto file for each unique UUID in the analysis file during upload.

partial resolved   Server Mode IS NOT IMPLEMENTED.

resolved   This release (due to it's nature) includes some noisy debug logging, please do your best to ignore the noise.

resolved   Only upload and download mode of this release should be used.  They operate like release 0.2.4 except download mode requires one extra parameter.


NOTES:   (for version 0.2.4, resolved items pushed down to the bottom of this section.)

   This release of GeneTorrent is not likely to be compatible with general purpose BitTorrent Clients.

   No error reporting occurs if communication with the tracker fails.

   No error reporting occurs if the seeder and download client can not communicate.

   This release does not support authentication or SSL.

   Web Services API integration is not implemented.

   This release lacks performance enhancements to fully utilize 10Gbps network connectivity.  In our lab tests the current GeneTorrent release yield sustains performance around 1.8Gbps.

Partially Resolved:  This release contain a couple of unhandled exceptions that result in the application crashing (incorrect analysis file name is one of them).  Please report these issues back to Cardinal Peak in case additional cases exist that have not been uncovered during testing.

Resolved:  Failure to use the -t command line option in upload mode will result in unpredictable behavior.  The next release of GeneTorrent will enforce the requirement for the -t option at start up when operating in upload mode.

Resolved:  The GeneTorrent application presently does not exit when transfers are completed.  Use CTRL-C to exit the applications at the conclusion of any transfers.

Resolved:  A 3rd party BitTorrent tracker is required to use GeneTorrent.  Cardinal Peak is using cbbt as a tracker during development.

Resolved:  All command line options have basic documentation available via the --help command line option.

Please contact Donavan (preferred) or Howdy with any questions.

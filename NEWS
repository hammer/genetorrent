GeneTorrent 3.7.4
*****************

Bug Fixes
---------

* **[GTXFER-61]** Expand GTO download retry logic. Improves error
  handling when downloading a GTO file fails by retrying up to 5
  times.

Known Issues
------------

* **[GTXFER-67]**  Peers that are banned for sending bad data seem to
  immediately reconnect and may send the same bad data again.  This may
  result in excess usage of system resources and bandwidth. *Carried
  over from previous release.*

GeneTorrent 3.7.2
*****************

November 30, 2012

Enhancements
------------

* Improved command line and configuration file option logging
  at startup.  This information is now printed in a more readable
  format, with one argument per line.

* The application name in syslog is no longer GeneTorrent.  Rather,
  it is one of gtserver, gtdownload, or gtupload.  Any automated
  process that relies on "GeneTorrent" to exist in GeneTorrent-
  related syslog lines must be adjusted.

* Added support for uploading torrents with multiple files and
  subdirectories.

Bug Fixes
---------

* **[GTXFER-59]** GeneTorrent Client waits several minutes after
  transfer is complete...

Known Issues
------------

* **[GTXFER-67]**  Peers that are banned for sending bad data seem to
  immediately reconnect and may send the same bad data again.  This may
  result in excess usage of system resources and bandwidth.

Build Information
-----------------

* GeneTorrent now builds shared libraries for dependencies
  on certain platforms and distributes them in a private
  library directory.  For CentOS 5 RPMs, the distributed libraries
  are openssl and several required boost libraries.  For CentOS 6
  RPMs, the distributed libraries are several required boost libraries.

* Code common to the three application binaries is built as a shared
  library called libgenetorrent.so.  This library does not have a stable
  API, and therefore it is not versioned and no -devel package is built or
  provided.

* The RPM build process outputs four binary RPMs

  * GeneTorrent-common - contains libgenetorrent, the dependency libraries,
    and a GeneTorrent wrapper script to enable "GeneTorrent --<mode>"
    style invocation.
  * GeneTorrent-download - contains the download client and its man page.
  * GeneTorrent-upload - contains the upload client and its man page.
  * GeneTorrent-server - contains the server, init scripts, configuration
    files, and the server man page.

Installation/Upgrade Information
--------------------------------

The new GeneTorrent-common package is required by the three application
packages.  The new GeneTorrent-common packages obsoletes the old GeneTorrent
RPM, which means that RPM removes it before installing GeneTorrent-common
when upgrading.

Because GeneTorrent-common does not provide any of the application binaries,
this can result in an upgrade without any of the previous functionality.
Be sure to install the -download, -upload, and -server packages as needed.

To install, as root::

  rpm -ivh [[filename.rpm] ...]

To upgrade::

  rpm -Uvh [[fileanem.rpm] ...]

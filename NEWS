GeneTorrent 3.8.0
*****************

January 17, 2013

Enhancements
------------

* Add gtperftest tool

* Remove legacy camel case long options.  These are filtered to new long option replacement in the GeneTorrent wrapper script.

* Modularize option parsing code.

* Don't use PACKAGE_NAME for syslog.  Added _progName member to gtBase to allow creating logger in a child which will use the correct program name when logging to syslog.

* Add cgsubmit and cgquery scripts and package them.

* Add system and restricted configuration files System configuration file at /etc/GeneTorrent.conf holds site-wide defaults.  Restricted configuration file at /etc/GeneTorrent-restricted.conf holds site-wide policy.  User may override system configuration file on the command line or via a user config file.  User may not override restricted configuration file.  Neither config file in /etc is provided by GeneTorrent packages.

* Implement allowed-servers and allowed-modes configuration options:  

  +  allowed-servers is a list of IP address (or ranges) given in a config file that limits the external servers (WSI, tracker, and peers) that the upload or download client will communicate with.  It has no effect on servers.
  +  allowed-modes can be specified in the system restricted config file to limit the operating modes that are valid on that system (ALL, UPLOAD, DOWNLOAD, SERVER).  If not specified, all modes are allowed.

* Man pages: add documentation for new options ( Restricted config file, System config file, allow-servers, allowed-modes, and disallow-user-config)

Bug Fixes
---------

* **[GTXFER-65]**  Disconnect peer if connect stalls.  When the server tries to make an outgoing connection to the client peer, the connection may not succeed due to firewalling or blocked ports. This blocked connection will never succeed, but it is blocking (until it times out) valid incoming connections from the client peer which slows down the creation of the peer connection.  The fix is to disconnect the peer that is stalled instead of the newer incoming connection (which is likely to succeed since it is incoming instead of outgoing).

* **[GTXFER-48]**  Need to suppress "sending announce (started)" messages.  For libtorrent::tracker_reply_alert and libtorrent::tracker_announce_alert alerts, suppress by lowering syslog level to LOG_DEBUG instead of LOG_INFO.

Known Issues
------------

* **[GTXFER-67]**  Peers that are banned for sending bad data seem to immediately reconnect and may send the same bad data again.  This may result in excess usage of system resources and bandwidth. *Carried over from previous release.*

GeneTorrent 3.7.4
*****************

December 07, 2012

Enhancements
------------

None. This is only a bug fix release.

Bug Fixes
---------

* **[GTXFER-61]** Expand GTO download retry logic. Improves error
  handling when downloading a GTO file fails by retrying up to 5
  times.

Known Issues
------------

* **[GTXFER-67]**  Peers that are banned for sending bad data seem to
  immediately reconnect and may send the same bad data again.  This may

GeneTorrent 3.7.2
*****************

November 30, 2012

Enhancements
------------

* Improved command line and configuration file option logging
  at startup.  This information is now printed in a more readable
  format, with one argument per line.

* The application name in syslog is no longer GeneTorrent.  Rather,
  it is one of gtserver, gtdownload, or gtupload.  Any automated
  process that relies on "GeneTorrent" to exist in GeneTorrent-
  related syslog lines must be adjusted.

* Added support for uploading torrents with multiple files and
  subdirectories.

Bug Fixes
---------

* **[GTXFER-59]** GeneTorrent Client waits several minutes after
  transfer is complete...

Known Issues
------------

* **[GTXFER-67]**  Peers that are banned for sending bad data seem to
  immediately reconnect and may send the same bad data again.  This may
  result in excess usage of system resources and bandwidth.

Build Information
-----------------

* GeneTorrent now builds shared libraries for dependencies
  on certain platforms and distributes them in a private
  library directory.  For CentOS 5 RPMs, the distributed libraries
  are openssl and several required boost libraries.  For CentOS 6
  RPMs, the distributed libraries are several required boost libraries.

* Code common to the three application binaries is built as a shared
  library called libgenetorrent.so.  This library does not have a stable
  API, and therefore it is not versioned and no -devel package is built or
  provided.

* The RPM build process outputs four binary RPMs

  * GeneTorrent-common - contains libgenetorrent, the dependency libraries,
    and a GeneTorrent wrapper script to enable "GeneTorrent --<mode>"
    style invocation.
  * GeneTorrent-download - contains the download client and its man page.
  * GeneTorrent-upload - contains the upload client and its man page.
  * GeneTorrent-server - contains the server, init scripts, configuration
    files, and the server man page.

Installation/Upgrade Information
--------------------------------

The new GeneTorrent-common package is required by the three application
packages.  The new GeneTorrent-common packages obsoletes the old GeneTorrent
RPM, which means that RPM removes it before installing GeneTorrent-common
when upgrading.

Because GeneTorrent-common does not provide any of the application binaries,
this can result in an upgrade without any of the previous functionality.
Be sure to install the -download, -upload, and -server packages as needed.

To install, as root::

  rpm -ivh [[filename.rpm] ...]

To upgrade::

  rpm -Uvh [[fileanem.rpm] ...]
